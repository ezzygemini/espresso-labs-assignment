# Espresso Labs Assignment

### Home Assignment for TypeScript Developers

Objective:

Build a simple web application that allows an admin to manage a network of agents.
The admin should be able to add, update, view, and delete agents in the network.

### Requirements:

- NVM (Node Version Manager) installed on your machine.
- Run `nvm install && nvm use` to prepare for node and npm.

### Instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the applications.

Load the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The login can be anything, there's no authentication yet.

#### Note:

The application is within a monorepo using npm workspaces. The client code is built with React and Vite,
while the server code is running on Node and Apollo GraphQL.
